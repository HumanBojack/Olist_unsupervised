# Olist unsupervised learning

In this **school** project, I had to use KMeans clustering in order to make a **customer segmentation**.

I made clusters on the [olist 2016-2018 e-commerce dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). I also used the [brazilian cities dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/crisparada/brazilian-cities?select=BRAZIL_CITIES_REV2022.CSV) in order to get the cities positions and calculate distances.

In the visualisations folder, you will find a html file showing my final segmentation (tsne.html).

You can also find the presentation I did on this project [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c1_BqvMfJqw-gljgGvgVqyzAJ-eS-bql5GsTlASFcDg/edit?usp=sharing) (in french).
